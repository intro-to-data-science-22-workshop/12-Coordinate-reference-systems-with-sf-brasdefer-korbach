# Working with dplyr


## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-22-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in November 2022. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-22) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2022.

### Session contents

This workshop session addresses Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS) and provides a short introduction into the sf package in R. In the presentation and the exercise materials, we give a short overview on how CRSs and simple features (sf) are constructed and used to store spatial data, to do geo-computations and to create map projections. Further, we introduce the most important functions of the sf package.

### Main learning objectives

The goals of this workshop session are to 

(1) provide students and practitioners with the basic knowledge of CRS and simple features,
(2) introduce the sf package and demonstrate its fundamental methods,
(3) provide exercises to enable students to apply the learned concepts in practice and 
(4) reference readings and materials for further study.
