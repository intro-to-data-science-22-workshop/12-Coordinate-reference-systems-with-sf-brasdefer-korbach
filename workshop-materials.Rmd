Hello everyone `r emo::ji("wave")`, 

we hope you have enjoyed our small presentation, refreshed your knowledge about Coordinate Reference Systems and got some insights on how geographic data they works in R and what potential data operations can be done with it.

Ready to play around with sf and do some simple operations and create a nice map in the end (hopefully) `r emo::ji("heart_eyes")`?  


*** 

In this little exercise we would like you to 


* **get a better feeling for CRS and the `sf`- package**  
* **understand how to access and read CRS data in R**
* **do simple data operations** 
* **learn how to create cool and interactive maps based on geographic data**

# Theory

Refreshing you memory from the presentation...

### Exercise (1) 
**In your own words, why do we need a “Coordinate Reference System” (CRS)? ** 
```{r}
#
#
```
# Setup

The first step is to download the concerning packages and import the libraries for using `sf` and the *spatial data*.

```{r}
# install.packages("sf", "spData", "spDataLarge")
# The Essentials
library(sf)   # classes and functions for vector data
library(tidyverse)     # for tidy data and ggplot2
# Datasets
library(rgdal) # dataset of city centers (points)
library(spData) # load explanatory geographic data
library(spDataLarge) # load larger geographic data 
#(Intermediary Mapping)
library(tmap) # to create nice and interactive maps
library(jsonlite) # Convert R objects to/from JSON
```
