*** 
Hello and welcome to our hands-on workshop session 👋,

We hope you enjoyed our presentation and gained a deeper understanding of spatial data and the `sf` package! Now, it's your turn to measure (and map) the world! 

In this exercise, you will

* further explore sf objects,
* learn to wrangle geographic data and
* create illustrative maps.

---

# Understanding CRS 🌎

## Exercise 1: Measuring the world
**After listening to the presentation, briefly talk to your neighbor... define the purpose of a CRS and discuss why it is important when dealing with spatial data.**

---

# Setup and Data 💻

First, we need to load all relevant packages and import the data we are going to use throughout the exercise. The data set contains the spatial data of all German districts as well as some population statistics.

```{r}
library(sf) # package for simple features
library(tidyverse)  
library(units) # package to convert units
```

```{r}
german_districts <- st_read("./Data/german_districts_clean.shp")
```

# sf objects ℹ️
Let's take a first look at the class of the `german_districts` object.

```{r}
class(german_districts)
```

The `german_districts` data set is saved as an `sf` object which at the same time is a data frame. That's great! Thanks to this, we can effortlessly use tidyverse methods to wrangle our data.

Let's make use of this fact in the first exercise!

## Exercise 2: Understanding sf objects
**Use the dplyr::select() function to select the 'district' column of the data frame and report the first five observations using the dplyr::head() and the print() function. What kind of information does the output contain? Does the output differ from what you expected?** 

```{r}
german_districts %>% 
  select(district) %>% 
  head(5) %>% 
  print
```
The output is structured as a simple feature collection gives us the following information:

- The data frame contains 5 features across 4 variables, in this context referred to as fields. 
- Simple features in form of polygons are saved in the `geometries` column (sfc).
- The CRS is the ETRS89 standard, a commonly used projected CRS used for European geo data.

Further, we can note that although we subset by the `district` column, the geographic metadata of `german_districts` data frame and the `geometry` column is not lost. We can say that the `sf` show 'sticky' behavior.

To retrieve even more information about the CRS of our data, we can use the `st_crs()` function:

```{r}
st_crs(german_districts)
```
As we can see in the output, we receive all relevant information about the CRS in the form of Well-Known-Text (WKT), such as the projected CRS, the ellipsoid used to model the surface of the earth, or the area where the CRS should be used.

We can also filter out the relevant CRS information in the different formats discussed in the presentation (EPSG and Proj4):

```{r}
st_crs(german_districts)$srid 
st_crs(german_districts)$proj4string
```

# Changing the CRS 🔀

For some applications and areas, certain types of CRSs are more suitable than others. For example, as we discussed in the presentation, certain projections focus on preserving the area of geographical features such as countries, while others focus on retaining the shape or the direction. Further, some CRSs use a local instead of a geocentric datum that better fits the surface of a specific location on earth (remember: the datum specifies the positioning of the ellipsoid with respect to the actual surface of the earth). To look up different CRSs,   you find more information on [Coordinate Systems Worldwide](https://epsg.io/).

We can change the CRS of an `sf` object by applying the `st_set_crs()` function:

```{r}
german_districts_equidistant <- german_districts %>%
  st_set_crs(4087)

st_crs(german_districts_equidistant)
```
Here, we set the CRS to the WGS84 / World Equidistant Cylindrical standard that uses the WGS84 ellipsoid - one of the most common ellipsoids used to model the earth - and projects geographical features in a way that preserves distances.

Now, its your turn to try the same. 💪

## Exercise 3: Setting the CRS
**Use the st_set_crs() function to change the CRS of german_districts to WGS84/ Pseudo-Mercator (EPSG:3857) and store it as german_districts_mercator. By applying the st_crs() function, retrieve more information about the WGS84/ Pseudo-Mercator standard.**

```{r}
german_districts_mercator <- german_districts %>% 
  st_set_crs(3857) # WGS84; commonly used by organizations that provide spatial data for the entire globe or many countries; for example used by Google Earth

st_crs(german_districts_mercator)
```

From the output, we can see that this CRS also uses the WGS 84 geographical reference system that is then mapped onto a two-dimensional cartesian plane as a Pseudo-Mercator projection.

Let's plot two maps of Germany with the two different CRS specifications:

```{r}
german_districts %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf() +
  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(4087)) +
  ggtitle("World Equidistant Cylindrical (EPSG 4087)") +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r}
german_districts %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf() +
  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(3857)) +
  ggtitle("WGS 84/Pseudo-Mercator (EPSG 3857)") +
  theme_bw()
```
$-$

As we can see, the specification of the two CRSs results in quite different representations of Germany.

# Computations with sf 🧭

In this section, we want to show that you can also do calculations with spatial data by utilizing `sf` package methods.

Let's use our spatial data to calculate the area of each German district.

## Exercise 4: Computing areas
**Calculate the areas of all German districts and store them in a new column within the data frame using the dplyr::mutate() function. Change the unit to square kilometers using the units::set_units() function of the units package. Report the area of Berlin.** 

```{r}
german_districts <- german_districts %>%
  mutate(area = set_units(st_area(german_districts), km^2))
```

```{r}
german_districts %>%
  filter(district == "Berlin") %>% 
  select(area)
```
Berlin has an area of 893 square kilometers.

Similar to the calculation of area, there are other functions in the `sf` package that you can use to do computations with simple features such as `st_length()`or `st_distance()`.

---

As a second step, let's calculate the population density for each district using the `dplyr` package. 
```{r}
german_districts <- german_districts %>%
  mutate(density = as.double(pop/area))
```

```{r}
district_points <- cbind(german_districts, st_coordinates(st_centroid(german_districts$geometry))) 

district_points <- district_points %>% 
  arrange(desc(density)) %>% 
  select(district, density) %>% 
  head(5)

print(district_points)
```
Based on our calculation, Munich is the densest city in Germany with a population density of 4656 inhabitants per square kilometer.

Now, let's use this information and exploit one of the most powerful techniques in geographic data handling: map-making!

# Creating illustrative maps 🗺️

An easy way to graph maps is the included `plot()` command that create a set of default maps corresponding to the attributes of our `sf` object. Let's plot the first three attributes:

```{r}
plot(german_districts, max.plot = 3)
```

Since `german_districts` is stored as a data frame, we can also utilize the ggplot package to create maps.

## Exercise 5: Creating a map 
**Create a map of the population density of all German districts using the ggplot package and the geom_sf() function.** 
Hint: To specify that you want to fill the districts according to the population density, set the "fill" attribute within the `aes()` command equal to the name of the population density column.

```{r}
german_districts %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = density)) +  
  scale_fill_viridis_c()
```

We can clearly see the densely populated parts of Germany: The big German cities of Hamburg in the north, Berlin in the north-east and Munich in the south.
